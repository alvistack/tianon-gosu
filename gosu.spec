%description
This is a simple tool grown out of the simple fact that su and sudo have
very strange and often annoying TTY and signal-forwarding behavior.
They're also somewhat complex to setup and use (especially in the case
of sudo), which allows for a great deal of expressivity, but falls flat
if all you need is "run this specific application as this specific user
and get out of the pipeline".
