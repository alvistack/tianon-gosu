Description: Simple Go-based setuid+setgid+setgroups+exec
 This is a simple tool grown out of the simple fact that su and sudo have
 very strange and often annoying TTY and signal-forwarding behavior.
 They're also somewhat complex to setup and use (especially in the case
 of sudo), which allows for a great deal of expressivity, but falls flat
 if all you need is "run this specific application as this specific user
 and get out of the pipeline".
